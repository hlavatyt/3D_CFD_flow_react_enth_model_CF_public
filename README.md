# 3D_CFD_flow_react_enth_model_CF_public

This repository contains examples of simulation folders for 3D CFD simulation of flow, diffusion-convection-reaction, and enthalpy transport within catalytic filter in automotive exhaust gas aftertreatment.

Repository contains:
  1) sim_isothermal: isothermal simulation using power-law kinetics 
  2) sim_non-isothermal: isothermal simulation using kinetics of inhibited CO conversion by O2
